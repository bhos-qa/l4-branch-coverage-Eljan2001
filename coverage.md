Code Coverage: 

  Code coverage is a simple metric to measure the effectiveness of your tests; increasing it helps you spot problems. That gives teams confidence in their tests, and increases the quality of your code. 
  To calculate the code coverage percentage, simply use the following formula: Code Coverage Percentage = (Number of lines of code executed by a testing algorithm/Total number of lines of code in a system component) * 100.

Branch Coverage:

  Branch coverage is a metric that indicates whether all branches in a codebase are exercised by tests. To calculate Branch Coverage, one has to find out the minimum number of paths which will ensure that all the edges are covered.

Statement Coverage: 

  Statement coverage technique is used to design white box test cases. All the statements should be executed at least once in the source code.

Predicate Coverage:

  Predicate coverage is also known as Condition Coverage in which each one of the Boolean expression have been evaluated to both TRUE and FALSE.
